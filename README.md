# Movies-ETL

**Purpose**

To perform an ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process for Amazon Prime Video. One function had to be created that took in three files, mainly: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data. To achieve this Wikipedia data was extracted and cleaned followed by Kaggle data and finally rating data. Once all the data was cleaned it was uploaded to Postgres SQL database. Approximately 6,042 rows from the movies data was uploaded and 26, 024,289 rows were imported to ratings table.
